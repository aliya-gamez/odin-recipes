    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These scrumptious coconut macaroons are very simple to make and only use four ingredients. They are golden and just a little crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside. Almond extract really brings out the flavor of the coconut. So divine and so easy! I often double this recipe around holiday time because I can't seem to make them fast enough for my coconut lovers!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 ¾ cups unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons almond extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place coconut in a bowl; add sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Mix well. Refrigerate batter for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Loosely mold batter into 2-inch balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are evenly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a sheet of waxed paper to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
